# Professional README Generator

## Description

This Professional README Generator allows the user to enter their README details and have a professional README file generated for them. This generator utilisies Node.js and prompts the user via the terminal to input their README's title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, Github username and email address, as well as choose a license from a supplied list.  Once the user has entered their details, the generator generates a README.md file. Throughout this project, I have learned and was able to utilise Node.js, the inquirer package and switch cases to prompt and accept user input and then write that to a .md file.
